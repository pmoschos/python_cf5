# Department ID Generator Script

Welcome to the Department ID Generator Script! This script demonstrates how to generate unique IDs for students based on their department using nested functions and nonlocal variables.

## Script Overview 📘

The script defines a `department_id_generator` function that creates a unique ID generator for a specified department. It uses a nested function to increment and format the IDs. The `main` function creates ID generators for different departments and demonstrates their usage.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
def department_id_generator(department):
    """
    Generate unique IDs for students based on department.

    Parameters:
    department (str): The name of the department.

    Returns:
    function: A function that generates unique IDs for the given department.
    """
    last_id = 0  # Initialize the last_id to zero

    def generate_id():
        """
        Generate a unique ID for a student in the department.

        Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the unique ID as a string and the last_id as an integer.
        """
        nonlocal last_id  # Declare last_id as nonlocal to modify it within the nested function
        last_id += 1  # Increment the last_id
        return f"{department}-{last_id}", last_id  # Return the formatted ID and last_id
    
    return generate_id  # Return the nested function

def main():
    # Create ID generators for Python and Android departments
    python_id_gen = department_id_generator("Python")
    android_id_gen = department_id_generator("Android")

    # Generate and print IDs using the Python ID generator
    print(python_id_gen())  # Expected output: ('Python-1', 1)
    print(python_id_gen())  # Expected output: ('Python-2', 2)

    # Generate and print IDs using the Android ID generator
    print(android_id_gen())  # Expected output: ('Android-1', 1)

    # Generate and print another ID using the Python ID generator
    print(python_id_gen())  # Expected output: ('Python-3', 3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

# Key Features 🌟
- **Reduce Function**: Learn how to use the reduce function to aggregate all elements in a range.
- **Lambda Function**: Discover how to define and use lambda functions for concise and readable code.
- **Factorial Calculation**: Understand how to calculate the factorial of a given integer using the reduce function and handle intermediate results.

## Technical Requirements 🔧
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended
- **External Libraries**: None (uses the built-in functools module)

## Installation and Setup 🚀
No installation is required, as the script can be run directly from any Python-enabled environment:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `04_closure.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `04_closure.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python 04_closure.py`.

## Usage Example 📋
Execute the script to see how the reduce function can be used to calculate the factorial of a given integer. The script will demonstrate this operation and print both the intermediate and final results.
