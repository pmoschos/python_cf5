# Demonstrating the Use of Type Hints in Python 🐍

This script demonstrates how to use various type hints from the `typing` module in Python, including `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple`, and `Set`. The script includes functions that process these types, enhancing code readability and type safety.

## Script Overview 📘

The script defines four functions:
- `process_items`: Processes a list of strings.
- `get_item_mapping`: Returns a dictionary mapping strings to integers.
- `get_coordinates`: Returns a tuple containing two floats.
- `unique_numbers`: Processes a set of integers.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple, Set

# List: A list with elements of a specific type.
# Dict: A dictionary with keys and values of specific types.
# Tuple: A tuple with a fixed number of elements, each with a specific type.
# Set: A set with elements of a specific type.

# Function that processes a list of strings
# The List type hint indicates that the function expects a list of strings as input
def process_items(items: List[str]) -> None:
    """
    Processes a list of strings.

    Parameters:
    items (List[str]): A list of strings to be processed.
    """
    # Implementation would go here
    # For now, it does nothing
    pass

# Function that returns a dictionary mapping strings to integers
# The Dict type hint indicates that the function returns a dictionary with string keys and integer values
def get_item_mapping() -> Dict[str, int]:
    """
    Returns a dictionary mapping strings to integers.

    Returns:
    Dict[str, int]: A dictionary with string keys and integer values.
    """
    # Returning a sample dictionary
    return {"apple": 1, "banana": 2}

# Function that returns a tuple containing two floats
# The Tuple type hint indicates that the function returns a tuple with two float elements
def get_coordinates() -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Returns a tuple containing two floats representing geographical coordinates.

    Returns:
    Tuple[float, float]: A tuple with two float elements.
    """
    # Returning a sample tuple representing geographical coordinates
    return (40.7128, -74.0060)

# Function that processes a set of integers
# The Set type hint indicates that the function expects a set of integers as input
def unique_numbers(numbers: Set[int]) -> None:
    """
    Processes a set of integers.

    Parameters:
    numbers (Set[int]): A set of integers to be processed.
    """
    # Implementation would go here
    # For now, it does nothing
    pass
```

### Key Features 🌟
- **Type Aliases**: Demonstrates the use of `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple`, and `Set` type hints for better code readability and type safety.
- **Function Annotations**: Provides clear type annotations for function parameters and return types, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Type Hinting**: Enhances code clarity by indicating the expected types of inputs and outputs for functions.

### Technical Requirements 🔧
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended
- **External Libraries**: None, only the built-in Python functionalities

### Usage Example 📋
Run the script directly in a Python environment to see how type hints improve code readability and type safety.
