# Python Integer Comparison Demonstration

Welcome to the Python Integer Comparison Demonstration! This script compares two integers provided by the user and prints the result. It also demonstrates the use of ternary operators in Python.

## Script Overview 📘

The script prompts the user to enter two integers, compares them, and prints the result. It also includes examples of using ternary operators for simple conditional expressions.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
def compare_integers(a, b):
    """
    Compares two integers and prints the result.

    Args:
    a (int): The first integer to compare.
    b (int): The second integer to compare.

    Returns:
    None
    """
    if a == b:
        print("The numbers are equal.")
    elif a > b:
        print("The first number is greater than the second number.")
    else:
        print("The first number is less than the second number.")

def main():
    try:
        # Get user input for the two integers
        a = int(input("Give me the first number: "))
        b = int(input("Give me the second number: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter valid integers.")
        return

    # Compare the integers
    compare_integers(a, b)

    # 1. Ternary operator (simple example)
    result = "Positive" if a > 0 else "Non-positive"
    print(result)

    # 2. Ternary operator (extended example)
    result = (
        "The numbers are equal." if a == b else
        "The first number is greater than the second number." if a > b else
        "The first number is less than the second number."
    )
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Key Features 🌟

- **Integer Comparison**: Learn how to compare two integers and print the result using conditional statements.
- **Ternary Operator**: Understand how to use ternary operators for simple conditional expressions in Python.
- **User Input Handling**: Discover how to capture and validate user input in Python.

## Technical Requirements 🔧

- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended
- **External Libraries**: None

## Installation and Setup 🚀

No installation is required, as the script can be run directly from any Python-enabled environment:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `05_ternary_operator_demo.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `05_ternary_operator_demo.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python 05_ternary_operator_demo.py`.

## Usage Example 📋

Execute the script and enter two integers when prompted. The script will compare the integers and print the result, demonstrating both traditional conditional statements and ternary operators.
