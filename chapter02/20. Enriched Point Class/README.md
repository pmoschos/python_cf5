# Python Object-Oriented Programming: Point Class Demonstration

Welcome to the Python Object-Oriented Programming: Point Class Demonstration! This script illustrates the use of classes in Python to manage and manipulate geometric points in 2D space. It is a valuable tutorial for anyone looking to understand class-based structures in Python, especially in an educational context.

## Script Overview üìò

The script demonstrates how to define a `Point` class with private attributes, utilize property decorators for attribute access and modification, and includes methods for comparing points and calculating distances between them.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
import math

class Point:
    """
    A class representing a point in 2D space.

    Attributes:
        __x (float): The x-coordinate of the point.
        __y (float): The y-coordinate of the point.
    """

    def __init__(self, x: float = 0, y: float = 0):
        """Initialize a Point instance with x and y coordinates."""
        self.__x = x
        self.__y = y

    @property
    def x(self) -> float:
        """Get the x-coordinate."""
        return self.__x

    @x.setter
    def x(self, value: float):
        """Set the x-coordinate."""
        if not isinstance(value, (int, float)):
            raise TypeError("x must be a number")
        self.__x = value

    @property
    def y(self) -> float:
        """Get the y-coordinate."""
        return self.__y

    @y.setter
    def y(self, value: float):
        """Set the y-coordinate."""
        if not isinstance(value, (int, float)):
            raise TypeError("y must be a number")
        self.__y = value

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        """Return a string representation of the Point."""
        return f"({self.__x}, {self.__y})"

    def __eq__(self, other: object) -> bool:
        """Check if two Points are equal."""
        if isinstance(other, Point):
            return self.__x == other.__x and self.__y == other.__y
        return False

    def __lt__(self, other: object) -> bool:
        """Check if this Point is less than another Point based on their coordinates."""
        if isinstance(other, Point):
            return (self.__x, self.__y) < (other.__x, other.__y)
        return NotImplemented

    def distance_to(self, other: 'Point') -> float:
        """Calculate the distance to another Point."""
        if isinstance(other, Point):
            return math.sqrt(math.pow(self.__x - other.__x, 2) + math.pow(self.__y - other.__y, 2))
        raise ValueError("The argument must be an instance of Point")

def main():
    # Create two Point objects
    p1 = Point(10, 20)
    p2 = Point(30, 40)
    print(f"Point 1: {p1}")
    print(f"Point 2: {p2}")
    
    # Check equality
    print(f"Are points equal? {p1 == p2}")
    
    # Calculate distance between points
    print(f"Distance between points: {p1.distance_to(p2)}")
    
    # Demonstrating the use of properties
    p1.x = 15
    p1.y = 25
    print(f"Updated Point 1: {p1}")

    # Demonstrating __lt__ method
    p4 = Point(0, 0)
    print(f"Is Point 4 less than Point 1? {p4 < p1}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

# Point Class Demonstration

Welcome to the Point Class Demonstration! This script is a practical showcase of how to utilize object-oriented programming concepts to manage geometric points in 2D space.

## Key Features üåü

- **Class Definition**: Learn how to define classes with encapsulated attributes and methods for handling complex data structures.
- **Properties and Setters**: Understand the use of property decorators to create controlled access to private attributes.
- **Special Methods**: Discover how to use special methods like `__str__`, `__eq__`, and `__lt__` to enhance the functionality of custom objects.
- **Mathematical Computations**: Implement mathematical methods to perform real-world calculations, such as distance measurement between points.

## Technical Requirements üîß

- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended.
- **External Libraries**: Uses Python's built-in `math` library for distance calculations.

## Installation and Setup üöÄ

No installation is required, as the script can be run directly from any Python-enabled environment:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `20_enriched_point_class_demo.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `20_enriched_point_class_demo.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python 20_enriched_point_class_demo.py`.

## Usage Example üìã

Execute the script to see how Point objects are created, manipulated, compared, and used in distance calculations. This demonstrates the practical applications of object-oriented programming in Python.
