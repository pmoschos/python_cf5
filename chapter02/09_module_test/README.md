# Python Main Application Script (`app.py`)

Welcome to the Python Main Application Script Demonstration! This script demonstrates how to use functions imported from another module in a Python application. It's an ideal resource for anyone new to Python or those teaching programming concepts related to module interaction and function calls.

## Script Overview 📘

The script includes a function import from `my_calculations.py` and uses it to perform an addition. The main focus is to show how to integrate and utilize external functions within an application.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
# Import addition function from my_calculations module
from my_calculations import my_add_function as my_add, num1

num2 = 10
# Call the addition function and store the result
res = my_add(num1, num2)

# Output the result
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {res}")

# Print the module name
print(__name__)
```

## Key Features 🌟
- **Function Importing**: Learn how to import and alias functions from different modules.
- **Using Imported Functions**: Demonstrates using imported functions to perform operations.
- **Print Statements**: Shows effective ways of integrating dynamic print statements for displaying results.

## Technical Requirements 🔧
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended
- **External Libraries**: None (Assuming `my_calculations.py` is part of the same project)

## Installation and Setup 🚀
This script can be executed in any Python-enabled environment:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Place both `app.py` and `my_calculations.py` in the same directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python app.py`.

## Usage Example 📋
Running the script will display the sum of two numbers and the name of the module. This demonstrates how functions can be modularized and reused across different parts of a Python application.
