# Python Placeholder Function Demonstration

Welcome to the Python Placeholder Function Demonstration! This script showcases a simple placeholder function intended to be replaced or extended with main functionality in future. It's an ideal resource for demonstrating the initial setup of a Python script structure for beginners or in educational settings.

## Script Overview 📘

The script includes a function called `empty_function` which serves as a placeholder for future code. It is currently implemented to do nothing (using the `pass` statement). This demonstrates how to define a function that can be expanded later.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
def empty_function():
    """
    Placeholder function for future main functionality.
    """
    pass

def main():
    # Call the empty_function
    print(empty_function())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Key Features 🌟
- **Function Placeholder**: Learn how to set up a function placeholder in Python, useful for structuring projects before full implementation.
- **Basic Function Call**: Understand the basics of defining and calling functions in Python, an essential skill in programming.
- **Script Structure**: Familiarize yourself with a typical Python script structure, including function definition and the special `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

## Technical Requirements 🔧
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended
- **External Libraries**: None

## Installation and Setup 🚀
No installation is required, as the script can be run directly from any Python-enabled environment:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `15_empty_func_demo.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `15_empty_func_demo.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python 15_empty_func_demo.py`.

## Usage Example 📋
Execute the script to see how the placeholder function operates (which will essentially do nothing and return None). This will help you understand the basic concepts of function setup and calling in Python programming.
