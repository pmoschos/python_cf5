# Python Floating-Point and Scientific Notation Demo

This README accompanies a Python script that demonstrates handling floating-point numbers and using scientific notation. This example helps in understanding precision in floating-point arithmetic and the convenience of expressing very large or small numbers using scientific notation.

## Script Overview 📘

The script introduces the constant PI as a floating-point number and demonstrates how to define and use a small number in scientific notation. It illustrates how Python handles these types of numbers, which is crucial for tasks requiring high precision and for operations in scientific computing.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
# Define a float variable for the mathematical constant PI
PI = 3.1415926535

# Print the value of PI and its type
print("Value of PI:", PI)
print("Type of PI:", type(PI))

# Define a small number using scientific notation
# Scientific notation is useful for expressing very large or very small numbers succinctly
small_num = 2.5e-3  # equivalent to 2.5 * 10^-3 or 0.0025

# Print the value of the small number and its type
print("Value of small number:", small_num)
print("Type of small number:", type(small_num))
```

## Key Features 🌟

- **Precision in Floating-Point Arithmetic**: Demonstrates how to handle floating-point numbers and discusses potential precision issues.
- **Scientific Notation**: Explains the use of scientific notation in Python for readability and efficiency in handling numerical data.
- **Practical Application**: Suitable for applications in science, engineering, and other fields where precision and large range numerical data are common.

## Technical Requirements 🔧

- **Python Version**: Python 3.x
- **External Libraries**: None required

## Installation and Setup 🚀

No installation is required, as the script can be run directly from any Python-enabled environment:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Download `10_floats_demo.py` from this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `10_floats_demo.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python 10_floats_demo.py`.

## Usage Example 📋

Upon execution, the script will display the values and types of predefined floating-point numbers and a number expressed in scientific notation, illustrating their practical use and importance in programming.
