# In Python, there is no specific 'char' data type like in some other languages; every character is treated as a string of length one.
character = 'a'  # Defined as a string with a single character

# Print the character and its data type using formatted string literals (f-strings)
print(f"'{character}' is type of: {type(character)}")
# Output will show that the type of 'character' is <class 'str'>, indicating it's a string
