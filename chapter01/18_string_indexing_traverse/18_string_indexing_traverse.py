# Define a string variable
message = "Coding Factory"

# Print individual characters using indexing (zero-indexed)
print(message[0])  # 'C'
print(message[1])  # 'o'
print(message[2])  # 'd'
print(message[3])  # 'i'
print(message[4])  # 'n'
print(message[5])  # 'g'

# Strings in Python are immutable, which means you cannot change an existing string directly
# The following line, if uncommented, would result in a TypeError because strings cannot be modified
# message[0] = 'c'

# Use len() to get the number of characters in the string
print(f"Number of letters inside the {message}: {len(message)}")  # Outputs the length of the message

# Iterate over each character in the string using a simple for-loop
# This is often called an "enhanced for" loop, similar to foreach in other languages
for char in message:
    print(char)  # Prints each character on a new line

# The range function generates a sequence of numbers, which by default starts from 0 and goes up to n-1
for i in range(10):
    print(i)  # Prints numbers 0 to 9

# Iterate over the string by index using a for-loop with range based on the length of the message
# Print each character without newline, separated by a space
for i in range(len(message)):
    print(message[i], end=" ")  # end=" " keeps the output on the same line
print()  # Print a newline at the end
