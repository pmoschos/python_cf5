# Python Variables and Data Types Demo

This README outlines a simple Python script that demonstrates the initialization of variables using different data types and different quotation styles for strings. This script is designed to help beginners understand basic Python variable types and print operations.

## Script Overview 📘

The script showcases the use of integers, strings, and boolean data types, utilizing both basic and complex variable declarations. It includes examples of different number systems for integers and various quotation techniques for strings.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
# Initialize three integer variables in different number systems
num1 = 10           # Decimal format
num2 = 0b1010       # Binary format
num3 = 0x000A       # Hexadecimal format

# Initialize string variables in various quotation styles
str1 = 'CF'         # Single quotes for short strings
str2 = "CF"         # Double quotes, interchangeable with single quotes for strings
str3 = 'Cod\
ing'                # Line continuation character used to extend the string across the newline

# Multi-line string using triple single quotes
str4 = '''Hello
Coding
Factory'''

# Multi-line string using triple double quotes
str5 = """Hello
again!
"""

# Boolean variable initialized as True
my_bool = True

# Print the initialized variables to observe their values and types
print(num1, num2, num3, str1, str2, str3, my_bool)
print("----------------")

# Display text to categorize output
print("Types:")

# Print the data types of each variable to show the distinction between them
print(type(num1))     # Should show <class 'int'>
print(type(num2))     # Should show <class 'int'>
print(type(num3))     # Should show <class 'int'>
print(type(str1))     # Should show <class 'str'>
print(type(str2))     # Should show <class 'str'>
print(type(str3))     # Should show <class 'str'>
print(type(str4))     # Should show <class 'str'>
print(type(str5))     # Should show <class 'str'>
print(type(my_bool))  # Should show <class 'bool'>
```

## Key Features 🌟
- **Variable Initialization:** Highlights initializing variables in various number systems and using different quoting styles for strings.
- **Data Type Display:** Demonstrates how to check and display the data types of variables.
- **Print Operations:** Focuses on basic output operations in Python.

## Technical Requirements 🔧
- **Python Version:** Python 3.x ![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x-blue.svg)
- **External Libraries:** None required ![Libraries](https://img.shields.io/badge/libraries-none-important)

## Installation and Setup 🚀
No installation is required, as the script can be run directly from any Python-enabled environment:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Download `02_my_literals.py` from this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `02_my_literals.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python 02_my_literals.py`.

## Usage Example 📋
Executing the script will output the initialized variable values and their respective types, providing a clear demonstration of how data types work in Python.
