# Python String Types Demonstration

Welcome to the Python String Types Demonstration! This script showcases various methods for defining and displaying strings in Python. It's an excellent resource for anyone new to Python or teaching programming concepts related to strings.

## Script Overview 📘

The script includes examples of defining strings using single quotes, double quotes, and creating multi-line strings with triple quotes. Each method is illustrated with clear examples to show the differences and use cases for each string type.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
# Define a string using single quotes
str1 = 'Hello'

# Define a string using double quotes
str2 = "Coding Factory"

# Define a multi-line string using triple single quotes
str3 = '''I
Love
Python'''

# Define a multi-line string using triple double quotes
str4 = """P
y
t
h
o
n"""

# Print each string to display their contents
print(str1)  # Outputs: Hello
print(str2)  # Outputs: Coding Factory
print(str3)  # Outputs the text in multi-line format:
             # I
             # Love
             # Python
print(str4)  # Outputs the text in multi-line format:
             # P
             # y
             # t
             # h
             # o
             # n
```
