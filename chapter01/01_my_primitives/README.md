# Basic Python Variable and Print Example

This Python script demonstrates simple variable assignments and print statements, ideal for beginners learning Python basics.

## Script Overview 📚

The script initializes four different types of variables and prints each one. Then it prints a separator line, followed by all variables in a single line. This is a great example for understanding basic data types and output formatting in Python.

### Script Code

```python
num = 10
height = 1.85
is_raining = True
hello_message = "Hello Coding Factory"

print(num)
print(height)
print(is_raining)
print(hello_message)

print("--------------------")
print(num, height, is_raining, hello_message)
```

## Key Features 🌟
- **Variable Initialization:** Demonstrates how to assign integer, float, boolean, and string values.
- **Print Statements:** Shows how to output variable values to the console.
- **Format Output:** Uses a separator line to differentiate between individual and combined variable outputs.

## Technical Requirements 🔧
- **Python Version:** Python 3.x ![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x-blue.svg)
