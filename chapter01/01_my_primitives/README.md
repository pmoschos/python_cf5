# Basic Python Variable and Print Example

This Python script demonstrates simple variable assignments and print statements, ideal for beginners learning Python basics.

## Script Overview 📚

The script initializes four different types of variables and prints each one. Then it prints a separator line, followed by all variables in a single line. This is a great example for understanding basic data types and output formatting in Python.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
# Define an integer variable with a value of 10
num = 10

# Define a floating-point variable for height in meters
height = 1.85

# Boolean variable to indicate whether it is raining or not
is_raining = True

# String variable containing a welcome message
hello_message = "Hello Coding Factory"

# Print individual variables to the console
print(num)
print(height)
print(is_raining)
print(hello_message)

# Print a separator to distinguish different outputs
print("--------------------")

# Print all variables in one line separated by spaces
print(num, height, is_raining, hello_message)

```

## Key Features 🌟
- **Variable Initialization:** Demonstrates how to assign integer, float, boolean, and string values.
- **Print Statements:** Shows how to output variable values to the console.
- **Format Output:** Uses a separator line to differentiate between individual and combined variable outputs.

## Technical Requirements 🔧
- **Python Version:** Python 3.x ![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x-blue.svg)
- **External Libraries:** None required ![Libraries](https://img.shields.io/badge/libraries-none-important)

## Installation and Setup 🚀
No installation is required, as the script can be run directly from any Python-enabled environment:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Download `01_my_primitives.py` from this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `01_my_primitives.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python 01_my_primitives.py`.

## Usage Example 📋
Here is what the output of the script looks like after execution:

```python
0
1.85
True
Hello Coding Factory
10 1.85 True Hello Coding Factory
```
