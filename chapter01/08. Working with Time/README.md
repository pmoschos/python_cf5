# Python Time Conversion Demo

This README accompanies a Python script that demonstrates how to convert a given number of seconds into days, hours, minutes, and seconds. This example is valuable for understanding basic arithmetic operations and modular arithmetic in Python.

## Script Overview 📘

The script prompts the user to enter a total number of seconds and then calculates how many days, hours, minutes, and seconds that amount of time corresponds to. This showcases how to perform integer division and modulus operations to break down time into more understandable units.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
# Constants for converting units of time
SECONDS_IN_A_MINUTE = 60
SECONDS_IN_AN_HOUR = 3600
SECONDS_IN_A_DAY = 86400

# Prompt the user to enter the total number of seconds
total_seconds = int(input("Enter the number of seconds: "))
# Example conversion: 105310 seconds is equal to: 1 day, 5 hours, 15 minutes, 10 seconds

# Calculate the number of days from the total seconds and the remainder
days = total_seconds // SECONDS_IN_A_DAY
seconds_remaining = total_seconds % SECONDS_IN_A_DAY

# Calculate the number of hours from the remaining seconds
hours = seconds_remaining // SECONDS_IN_AN_HOUR
seconds_remaining %= SECONDS_IN_AN_HOUR  # Update the seconds_remaining by applying modulus

# Calculate the number of minutes from the updated remaining seconds
minutes = seconds_remaining // SECONDS_IN_A_MINUTE
seconds_remaining %= SECONDS_IN_A_MINUTE  # Further reduce the remaining seconds

# The final value of seconds_remaining is the number of seconds
seconds = seconds_remaining

# Display the results in a clear, formatted way
print(f"{total_seconds} seconds is equal to:")
print(f"{days} days, {hours} hours, {minutes} minutes, {seconds} seconds")
```

## Key Features 🌟

- **Time Conversion**: Demonstrates how to break down a large number of seconds into more manageable time units.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Uses modulus operations to efficiently calculate remainders for time conversion.
- **Clear Output**: Provides clear, formatted output that enhances readability and understanding.

## Technical Requirements 🔧

- **Python Version**: Python 3.x
- **External Libraries**: None required

## Installation and Setup 🚀

No installation is required, as the script can be run directly from any Python-enabled environment:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Download `08_time_app.py` from this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `08_time_app.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python 08_time_app.py`.

## Usage Example 📋

Upon execution, the script will prompt the user to input the total number of seconds. After input, it will display the breakdown of this time into days, hours, minutes, and seconds, providing a practical demonstration of time unit conversion.
