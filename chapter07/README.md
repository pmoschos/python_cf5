### Detailed Script Explanations 📝

#### `point.py` 📐
- Defines a `Point` class with various operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication, along with comparison methods.
  - **Explanation**: This script introduces a `Point` class to represent points in a 2D space. The class includes methods for adding, subtracting, and multiplying points or numbers, and comparing points for equality or inequality. The use of magic methods like `__add__`, `__sub__`, and `__mul__` allows for intuitive arithmetic operations with point objects.

#### `point_app.py` 🔄
- Demonstrates the usage of the `Point` class.
  - **Explanation**: This script contains a `main` function that creates instances of the `Point` class and demonstrates various operations like addition and equality checks. It's a practical example of how the `Point` class can be used in a real-world scenario.

#### `tests.py` ✅
- Unit tests for the `Point` class to ensure its correctness.
  - **Explanation**: This script uses the `unittest` framework to define a test suite for the `Point` class. It includes tests for all major functionalities like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison operations. These tests help ensure that the `Point` class behaves as expected.

#### `insert_data.py` 💾
- Script to insert data into a MySQL database.
  - **Explanation**: This script provides functions to connect to a MySQL database and insert data into a `teachers` table. It demonstrates basic database operations like establishing a connection, executing an insert statement, and handling exceptions.

#### `update_data.py` ✏️
- Script to update data in a MySQL database.
  - **Explanation**: Similar to `insert_data.py`, this script focuses on updating existing records in the `teachers` table of a MySQL database. It includes functions to create a database connection and update a teacher's information, showcasing essential CRUD operations.

### Educational Value 🎓
- Code snippets and scripts for direct classroom use
- Demonstrative examples to explain core programming concepts

### Innovative Solutions 💡
