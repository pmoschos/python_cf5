# Capitalizing City Names Script

Welcome to the Capitalizing City Names Script! This script demonstrates how to capitalize the first letter of each city name in a list using the `map` function and a lambda function.

## Script Overview 📘

The script defines a list of city names and uses the `map` function with a lambda function to capitalize each city name. It utilizes the `title()` method to convert the first character of each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
# List of city names
cities = ["london", "paris", "barcelona", "athens"]

# Using map and a lambda function to capitalize each city name
# The title() function is used to convert the first character of each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase
cap_cities = list(map(lambda city: city.title(), cities))

# Printing the list of capitalized city names
print("Capitalized Cities:", cap_cities)
```
