# Filtering and Capitalizing City Names Script

Welcome to the Filtering and Capitalizing City Names Script! This script demonstrates how to filter city names based on their length and capitalize the filtered names using `filter`, `map`, and lambda functions.

## Script Overview 📘

The script defines a list of city names and uses a lambda function with the `filter` function to filter out city names longer than 5 characters. It then capitalizes these filtered names using another lambda function with the `map` function.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
# List of city names
cities = ["london", "paris", "barcelona", "athens", "Casablanka"]

# Filtering city names longer than 5 characters using filter and lambda
long_cities = filter(lambda city: len(city) > 5, cities)

# Capitalizing the filtered city names using map and lambda
cap_length_cities = list(map(lambda city: city.title(), long_cities))

# All in one line
# cap_length_cities = list(map(lambda city: city.title(), filter(lambda city: len(city) > 5, cities)))

# Printing the list of transformed city names
print("Capitalized Cities with more than 5 characters:", cap_length_cities)

# Using list comprehension to filter and capitalize city names
# cap_length_cities = [city.title() for city in cities if len(city) > 5]

# Printing the transformed list
print("Capitalized Cities with more than 5 characters:", cap_length_cities)
```

## Key Features 🌟

- **Filter Function**: Learn how to use the `filter` function to select elements from a list based on a condition.
- **Map Function**: Discover how to use the `map` function to apply a transformation to each element in a filtered list.
- **Lambda Function**: Understand how to define and use lambda functions for concise and readable code.
- **List Comprehension**: See an alternative approach using list comprehension to achieve the same result.

## Technical Requirements 🔧

- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended
- **External Libraries**: None

## Installation and Setup 🚀

No installation is required, as the script can be run directly from any Python-enabled environment:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `16_map_filter_lambda.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `16_map_filter_lambda.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python 16_map_filter_lambda.py`.

## Usage Example 📋

Execute the script to see how to filter city names longer than 5 characters and capitalize them using the `filter` and `map` functions along with lambda functions. The script will demonstrate the transformation by printing the list of filtered and capitalized city names.
